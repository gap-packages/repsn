                   README file for REPSN - A GAP4 package - version 3.0.2
                   ======================================================

This is the README file for the GAP package ``REPSN''.

This package is for computing matrix representations in characteristic zero of finite groups.

This package only works with GAP4.3 (and higher versions).

The REPSN package is distributed with the accepted GAP packages.

============================================================================

Documentation:

The manual of REPSN is contained in /pkg/repsn/doc. There are the
following files (among others):

     * manual.dvi       dvi version of the manual
     * manual.pdf       pdf version of the manual

REMARKS.

    * The documentation of REPSN was made using the GAPDoc package.
      Therefore, in order to be able to use the online help you must 
      install the GAPDoc package, see

      http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/index.html


============================================================================

Installing `REPSN':

1) unpack `repsn.zip' in the `pkg' subdirectory of the GAP root
   directory.

2) From within GAP load the package with:

gap> LoadPackage("repsn");


===========================================================================

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
