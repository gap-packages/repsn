 <P/>This manual describes the <Package>Repsn</Package> package for computing matrix representations in 
characteristic zero of finite groups. Most of the functions in <Package>Repsn</Package>
 have been written according to the algorithm described in the author's
 Ph.D thesis <Cite Key="Dab-03"/> and <Cite Key="DD-10"/> (see <Cite Key="Dab-05"/>).

 <P/>For constructing representations of simple groups and their covers
  we use the algorithm described in <Cite Key="Dix-93"/>. To use this
  algorithm for constructing a representation of a group <M>G</M>
  affording an irreducible character <M>\chi</M> of <M>G</M>, we need to have
  a subgroup <M>H</M> of <M>G</M> such that the restriction of <M>\chi</M> to <M>H</M>
  has a linear constituent with multiplicity one. In this case we
  say <M>H</M> is a <E>character subgroup</E> relative to <M>\chi</M> (or a
 <M>\chi</M>-subgroup). A <M>\chi</M>-subgroup for each irreducible character
 <M>\chi</M> of degree less than 100 of simple groups and their covers are
 listed in <Cite Key="Dab-06"/> and <Cite Key="Dab-07"/>.
  
 <P/>All <Package>Repsn</Package> functions are written entirely in the &GAP; language. It
 is proved in <Cite Key="Dab-05"/> and <Cite Key="DD-10"/> that the algorithm is correct for any
 group with a character of degree less than 100. Indeed, if the group is
 solvable, there is no restriction on the character degree. In
 practice the program is quite fast when the degree is small, but
 can be very slow when it is necessary to call one of the
 subprograms which extend irreducible representations. In the
 latter case the number of element wise operations required to
 extend a representation of degree <M>d</M> is proportional to <M>d^6</M>.

 <P/><Package>Repsn</Package> is implemented in the &GAP; language, and runs on any
 system supporting &GAP;4. The <Package>Repsn</Package> package is loaded into the current &GAP; session with the command

   <Verb> gap> LoadPackage( "repsn" ); </Verb>

 (see section <E>Loading a GAP Package</E> in the &GAP; Reference Manual).

<P/>

Please report any bugs or other issues you might encounter via the

<Chapter><Heading>Irreducible Representations</Heading>

Let <M>G</M> be a finite group and <M>\chi</M> be an ordinary irreducible character of
<M>G</M>.  In this chapter we introduce some functions to construct a complex representation
<M>R</M> of <M>G</M> affording <M>\chi</M>. We proceed recursively, reducing the problem to smaller
subgroups of <M>G</M> or characters of smaller degree until we obtain a problem which we
can deal with directly.

Inputs of most of the functions are a given group <M>G</M>, and an irreducible character
<M>\chi</M>. The output is a mapping (representation) which assigns to each generator <M>x</M>
of <M>G</M> a matrix <M>R(x)</M>. We can use these functions for
all groups and all irreducible characters <M>\chi</M> of degree less than 100 although in
principle the same methods can be extended to characters of larger degree.

The main methods in these functions which are used to construct representations 
of finite groups are Induction, Extension, Tensor Product and Dixon's method 
(for constructing representations of simple groups and their covers) <Cite Key="Dab-05"/>, and Projective Representation method <Cite Key="DD-10"/>.


  <Section>
  <Heading>Constructing Representations</Heading>
  
   This section introduces the main function to compute a representation of a finite group 
 <M>G</M> affording an irreducible character <M>\chi</M> of <M>G</M>.  
    
  <ManSection>
           <Func Name="IrreducibleAffordingRepresentation" Arg=" chi "/>
		   
        <Description>
		called with an irreducible character <A>chi</A> of a group <M>G</M>,
 this function returns a mapping
(representation) which maps each generator of <M>G</M> to a <M>d*d</M> 
matrix, where <M>d</M> is the degree of <A>chi</A>. 
The group generated by these matrices (the image of the
map) is a matrix group which is isomorphic to <M>G</M> modulo the
 kernel of the map. If <M>G</M> is a solvable group then there is no restriction 
on the degree of <A>chi</A>. In the case that <M>G</M> is not solvable and the character <A>chi</A>
has degree bigger than 100
the output maybe is not correct. In this case sometimes the output mapping does not 
afford the given character or it does not return any mapping.

 <Example>
gap> s := PerfectGroup( 129024, 2 );;
gap> G := Image(IsomorphismPermGroup( s ));;
gap> chi := Irr( G )[36];;

then <Code>IsAffordingRepresentation</Code> returns <Code>true</Code> if the trace of <A>rep(x)</A> equals 
<A>chi(x)</A> for all elements  <M>x</M> in <M>G</M>.

This function returns a list of irreducible representations of <M>G</M> which are constituents of 
<A>rep</A>, and their corresponding multiplicities. For example, if <A>rep</A> is a representation of <M>G</M>
affording a character <M>X</M> such that <M>X = mY + nZ</M>, where <M>Y</M> and <M>Z</M> are irreducible characters of <M>G</M>, 
and <M>m</M> and <M>n</M> are the corresponding multiplicities, then <Code>ConstituentsOfRepresentation</Code> returns <M>[[m, S]</M>, <M>[n, T]]</M> where
 <M>S</M> and <M>T</M> are irreducible representations of <M>G</M> affording <M>Y</M> and <M>Z</M>, respectively. This function 
call can be quite expensive when <M>G</M> is a large group.

        <Description>
If <A>rep</A> is a reducible representation of a group <M>G</M>,
this function returns a block diagonal representation of <M>G</M> equivalent to 
<A>rep</A>. If <A> list </A> <M>= [[m1, R1]</M>, <M>[m2, R2]</M>, ... , <M>[mt, Rt]]</M> is a list of irreducible representations
<M>R1</M>, <M>R2</M>, ... , <M>Rt</M> of <M>G</M> with multiplicities <M>m1</M>, <M>m2</M>, ... , <M>mt</M>, then <Code>EquivalentBlockRepresentation</Code>
returns a block diagonal representation of <M>G</M> containing the blocks <M>R1</M>, <M>R2</M>, ... , <M>Rt</M>.
