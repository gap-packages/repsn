  Let  G  be a finite group and chi be an ordinary irreducible character of G.
  In  this  chapter  we  introduce  some  functions  to  construct  a  complex
  representation  R  of  G affording chi. We proceed recursively, reducing the
  problem  to  smaller subgroups of G or characters of smaller degree until we
  obtain  a  problem  which  we  can deal with directly. Inputs of most of the
  functions  are a given group G, and an irreducible character chi. The output
  is  a  mapping  (representation)  which  assigns  to each generator x of G a
  matrix  R(x).  We can use these functions for all groups and all irreducible
  characters chi of degree less than 32 although in principle the same methods
  can  be  extended  to characters of larger degree. The main methods in these
  functions  which  are used to construct representations of finite groups are
  induction,  extension,  tensor  product and Dixon's method (for constructing
  representations of simple groups and their covers).

  This  section  introduces the main function to compute a representation of a
  finite group G affording an irreducible character chi of G.

  called with an irreducible character [22m[34mchi[0m of a group G, this function returns
  a  mapping  (representation) which maps each generator of G to a d*d matrix,
  where  d  is  the  degree of [22m[34mchi[0m. The group generated by these matrices (the
  image  of  the  map)  is  a matrix group which is isomorphic to G modulo the
  kernel  of the map. If G is a solvable group then there is no restriction on
  the  degree of [22m[34mchi[0m. In the case that G is not solvable and the character [22m[34mchi[0m
  has  degree  bigger  than  31  the output maybe is not correct. In this case
  sometimes  the output mapping does not afford the given character or it does
  not return any mapping.

  returns  a  list  of  all [22m[34mchi[0m-subgroups of [22m[34mG[0m among the lattice of subgroups.
  This  function  call  can  be quite expensive for larger groups. The call is
  expensive  in  particular  if the lattice of subgroups of the given group is
  not yet known.

  [1m[34m> EquivalentRepresentation( [0m[22m[34mrep[0m[1m[34m ) __________________________________[0mfunction
  
  computes  an  equivalent representation to an irreducible representation [22m[34mrep[0m
  by  transforming  [22m[34mrep[0m to a new basis by spinning up one vector (i.e. getting
  the  other  basis  vectors  as images under the first one under words in the
  generators).   If   the   input   representation,  [22m[34mrep[0m,  is  reducible  then
  [22m[32mEquivalentRepresentation[0m  does  not  return  any  mapping.  In this case see
  section 3.
