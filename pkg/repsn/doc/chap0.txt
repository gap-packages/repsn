  This  package was obtained during my Ph.D. studies at Carleton University. I
  would  like  to  express  deep  gratitude to my supervisor Professor John D.
  Dixon  whose guidance and support were crucial for the successful completion
  of  this  project.  I  also  thank Professor Charles Wright and referees for
  pointing out some important comments to improve [1mRepsn[0m.
  
  This  documentation was prepared with the [1mGAPDoc[0m package by Frank Lübeck and
  Max Neunhöffer.
