  [1XAcknowledgements[0m
  The  first  version  of this package was obtained during my Ph.D. studies at
  Carleton University. I would like to express deep gratitude to my supervisor
  Professor  John  D.  Dixon  whose  guidance and support were crucial for the
  successful completion of this project. I also thank Professor Charles Wright
  and referees for pointing out some important comments to improve [5XRepsn[0m.
  
  This  documentation was prepared with the [5XGAPDoc[0m package by Frank LÃ¼beck and
  Max NeunhÃ¶ffer.
